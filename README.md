# BufferedCraterCounting
Buffered Crater Counting, following the technique by Fasset and Head (2008). It creates an SSC file for CraterStats. It needs ArcGIS 10+ to run.

# DTM Minus Scale
![MOLA Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhpoosthoek/Planetary/master/DTMMinusScale/MOLAExample.jpg)
DTMMinusScale generates a smoothed interpolated version of a DTM and subtracts this from the DTM. The cellfactor is the smoothing factor.
